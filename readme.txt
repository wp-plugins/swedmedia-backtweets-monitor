Swedmedia Backtweets Monitor is a simple Dashboard Widget that displays what people are saying about your blog on Twitter. 

== Description ==

Swedmedia Backtweets Monitor is a plugin that scans Backtweets.com for mentions of your blog and your posts on Twitter and displays them on your dashboard. Backtweet is an excellent service for monitoring your reputation on Twitter and this brings that to Wordpress.

The plugin works out-of-the-box once you activate it. It shows up immediately on your Dashboard and if you want to you can select a Twitter-account to ignore from the feed. Since you probably use Twitter to post your blogs that might be a good idea.

Hope you like it. Works for me.
